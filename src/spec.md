# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update site branding to use the provided ABM Nexttech LLP logo and adjust Product/Services messaging to reflect current development status and service offerings.

**Planned changes:**
- Add the provided `ABMNexttech.png` as a public static asset and replace the existing generated wordmark logo in the site header and footer (with alt text “ABM Nexttech LLP” and responsive-safe sizing).
- Update `ProductPage` copy to clearly state the AI-driven bank reconciliation product is in development, launching soon, and that a demo will be available soon (ensuring CTAs do not imply immediate demo access).
- Update `ServicesPage` to explicitly include implementation, support, and development as service offerings, and align any Home page services summary to avoid conflicting messaging.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors see the new ABM Nexttech LLP logo in the header/footer, understand the product is launching soon with a demo available soon, and can view services that explicitly include implementation, support, and development.
