  "summary": "Implemented a reusable BrandMark component with image + text fallback and wired it into both SiteHeader (desktop + mobile sheet) and SiteFooter. However, the diff summary does not show the actual logo asset being added/moved into a production-served static assets directory, so the “no 404 in deployed build / correct casing / file present” part of REQ-19 cannot be verified from the provided changes.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-19",
      "requirement": "Ensure the logo asset path is valid in production builds (including case sensitivity), the file is present in the correct static assets directory, and the deployed build loads the logo without 404s.",
      "reason": "BrandMark references an absolute path (/assets/generated/abm-nexttech-wordmark-transparent.dim_1200x300.png), but the diff summary does not include adding or relocating the referenced image into a static/public assets directory. Without evidence of the file existing at that exact path and casing, the “no 404”/production validity requirement is not confirmed.",
